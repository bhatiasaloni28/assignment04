## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library("haven")
data <- read_dta('/Users/salonibhatia/Desktop/Semester III - Coursework /Intro to Data Science/Session 5 /assignment04/data/learning_loss_covid_database.dta')

library(ggplot2)

# Scatter Plot + Line 
ggplot(data, aes(x = weeks, y = loss, color = "Line")) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red", linetype = "dashed")
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Weeks Closed on Average in 2021") + 
  ylab("Decline in Test Scores (measured in standard deviation units)") +
  ggtitle("Decline in Test Scores due to School Closure") 
```

```{r}
# Line Graph 
  ggplot(data, aes(x = weeks, y = loss, color = "Line")) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 1, shape = 16) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightgray"),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", size = 0.5),
    legend.position = "top"  # Adjust legend position
  ) +
  xlab("weeks") +
  ylab("Learning Loss") +
  ggtitle("Line Graph") +
  labs(color = "Legend Title") 

```

```{r}
# Another Version 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(data, mapping = aes(x = weeks, y = loss)) +
    geom_smooth(data, mapping = aes(x = weeks, y = loss))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
